* Run-Length Encoding
This is an Idris implementation of run-length encoding

** Compiling
Compilation requires at least Idris 1.0 to be installed as well as a C
toolchain.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ idris --build RLE.ipkg
#+END_SRC

The output should be an executable named =rle= in this directory

** Running

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./rle
#+END_SRC

Running the program will result in the test string in =src/Main.idr= being
compressed and output into =output.bin=.
