* Assignment Problem
This package contains three Idris implementations of the first two steps of the
Hungarian algorithm

** Compiling
Compilation requires at least Idris 1.0 to be installed as well as a C
toolchain.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ idris --build assignment.ipkg
#+END_SRC

The output should be an executable named =assignment= in this directory

** Running

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./assignment
#+END_SRC

Running the program will result in the three different implementations being run
over the same test input, =[[250, 400, 350], [400, 600, 350], [200, 400, 250]]=
